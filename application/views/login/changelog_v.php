23/07/2016 - Presenting the ETM blog! New features, discussions, sneak peaks and some insights into this project and contributors. <br>
19/07/2016 - Due to the steady growth of new features and new users, ETM might need another server upgrade for which I had to setup some ads to help out with expenses.  <br>
If you would like to support this website and don't mind some footer banners being displayed then turning off your ad-blocker would be a great help. Thank you!<br>
17/07/2016 - New Transaction page improvements: aggregation(all characters) and individual (current character) toggle. <br>
Transaction unlinking is now possible, which excludes an individual transaction from the profits calculation queue 
(useful for  personal use purchases that you don't want to be associated with future sales). 
Please be careful when unlinking transactions, and only use it if you know what you're doing, as this can have negative consequences on profit accuracy if done incorrectly!
Also improved performance for the transactions page significantly. <br>
Statistics page now links to the detailed profits results for each featured item and has a new volumes graph. <br>
10/07/2016 - Partial Citadel support added: transactions and profits originating from citadel markets should now be visible.  <br>
